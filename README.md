# Movie Analysis with PySpark

## Project Overview
This project leverages PySpark to analyze extensive movie datasets, uncovering insights into trends, patterns, and relationships within the data. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model training. The analysis and results are documented in a Jupyter Notebook and a detailed presentation.

---

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data and outliers across multiple datasets.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting key features for predictive modeling.
- **Machine Learning**: Training and evaluating models to analyze movie data trends.
- **Visualization**: Insights represented visually through graphs and plots.

---

## Data
The project uses multiple CSV files, including:
- `movie_training.csv`: Training dataset for modeling.
- `movies_tr_X.csv`, `movies_tr_y.csv`: Training features and labels.
- `movies_te_X.csv`, `movies_te_y.csv`: Test features and labels.
- `oscar_data.csv`: Data related to Oscar-winning movies.
- `Nodes.csv` and `Edges.csv`: Data for relationship analysis.
